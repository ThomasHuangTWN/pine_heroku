# Pine

### Highlights
Pine is a light-weight **library system** which provides borrowing services for **libraries without a librarian**.
The website **simplies the borrow procedure** by seperating the process into 3 steps: **reserve, schedule, checkout**.
The borrower reserves a book online, and a staff member schedules a checkout date.
The fuctionality of specifying when to hand over the book means that librarians do not have to stay in the library all day long.
Also, by simplifying the borrowing process, libraries attract more borrowers and expand the influence of libraries.

### Successful Applications
The first organization to embrace the Pine system is the Computer Software Designing Club of HsinChu Senior High School in Taiwan.
